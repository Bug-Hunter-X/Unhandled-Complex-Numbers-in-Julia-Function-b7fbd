# Unhandled Complex Numbers in Julia Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia:  a function that doesn't correctly handle complex numbers. The original function (`bug.jl`) incorrectly computes the square of complex numbers. The improved function (`bugSolution.jl`) addresses this issue. 

The solution highlights the importance of explicit handling of complex numbers or using more general functions that can handle various numeric types.  Further improvements for error handling, documentation, and type stability are suggested.
